        It’s TIMPA TIME! That’s Jamie Timpa – this sizzlin’ Sicilian that hails from Rockwall, Texas is launching
        her debut EP in October, 2017 while attending classes as a new freshman at the University of Denver.
        She won’t be there long because she is HIT BOUND!<br><br>
        Jamie has been journeying to Nashville since she was thirteen years old perfecting her craft of vocal
        lessons with highly regarded Brett Manning and co-writing with a number of great synergistic writer
        producers like current EP producers Bobby “Mutt” Huff and Garen Gueyikian.<br><br>
        All songs originate from powerful experiences that have impacted her life story and all expressed in her
        own unique style of storytelling. With the devastating loss August, 2016 of her older brother Tony, you
        feel her pain with the haunting ballad, “Why’d You Have To Go?”.<br><br>
        “Slither” captures the emotion and anger of a relationship gone astray with graphic metaphors etched
        permanently with ardent fans. “You’re a slithering snake; venom in my veins – turn all my hopes to rain.
        Just one bite destroyed my life; ate the apple –couldn’t stay away…..STAY AWAY!” <br><br>
        “Outcast” completely defines the feeling of being so different and off-kilter with the cool set of current
        totally plastic fake peers that you’re thought of as a total freak. “They say we’re players in a freak show,
        rolling weird and weak – OH. They’re just planting mean seeds, sprouting up hate trees – rooted in
        exclusion, spitting out pollution. Everyone’s unique –why they gotta be abusive?” “They call us outcasts,
        low class, caterpillars that won’t turn into a butterfly.” <br><br>
        Jamie performs full band with shows based regionally out of Nashville, Denver and Dallas, with her
        debut album scheduled for release in March, 2018 and her launch tour scheduled for June 2018. Don’t
        miss this one of a kind diva on all streaming services, social media and playing soon at your favorite
        venue. </span>
